of West Nile Virus Infection Based on Dead Bird Surveillance,"

Description: County level data for South Carolina on numbers of cases
west nile virus in birds and equines, numbers of farms, area, and population.
Key variables:
Positive Bird Rate = # Bird Cases of West Nile / Human Population
Positive Equine Rate = # of Equine Cases of West Nile / # Farms

Poisson Regression Model: # Equine Cases = PBR + Human Density + PBR*HD
w/ log(farms) as offset

Variables/Columns
county   1-24
bird cases   25-27
equine cases  34-35
farms  40-43
area     47-51
population   53-59
human density    61-67
positive bird rate   71-79
Positive Equine Rate   83-91
